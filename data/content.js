The main research question I address is: how might these challenges limit people’s engagement in efficient explorations of data, and how might these limitations be remedied? I define the four challenges in terms of subcosts of van Wijk’s perception and exploration costs; these are: 1) a literacy cost, 2) a context interpretation cost, 3) a perceived interactivity cost, and 4) an initial incentive for exploration cost. For each, I propose either a way to assess or a method to help overcome the sub-cost. I also investigate whether popular techniques recommended for making visualizations engaging outside of purely analytical contexts can lead online users to explore data.<br/><br/><strong>Keywords—</strong>Data visualisation, Infographics, Information visualization, Information visualization for the People, Narrative visualization, Visualization literacy, Perceived affordances, Suggested interactivity, Visual communication, Open data.", img: null, img_lg: null, video: "", video_note: "", width: 1, link: "http://peopleviz.gforge.inria.fr/trunk/", pdf: "http://jyby.eu/phd_dissertation/2015_ENST_0025_Jeremy_Boy.pdf", bib: null, year: 2015, award: "IEEE VGTC VIS Pioneer Group Honorable Mention Award" },

In this paper we present an investigation of nodelink visualizations for communication and how to better support their creation. We begin by breaking down these images into their basic elements and analyzing how they are created. We then present a set of techniques aimed at improving the creation workflow by bringing more flexibility and power to users, letting them manipulate all aspects of a node-link diagram (layout, visual attributes, etc.) while taking into account the context in which it will appear. These techniques were implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype called GraphCoiffure, which was designed as an intermediary step between graph drawing/editing software and image authoring applications.

This paper proposes a method for assessing VL based on Item Response Theory.

Though the value of information visualization is becoming apparent to a broad audience, visualization researchers often acknowledge that people have different levels of understanding of visualization techniques. In other words, our understanding of how users interpret visualizations has not caught up with design and technical developments, and even the concept of visualization literacy is still debated. Different domains of research, such as mathematics education, cognitive science, and psychology, have been approaching this problem within their domain. We believe that researchers in information visualization and visual analytics should lead the effort in defining the concept, and in creating valid and practical measurement tools. The goal of our workshop is to take a step in this direction by developing a better understanding of visualization literacy, identifying possible metrics for evaluation, and raising new questions for future research through the design and evaluation of visualization literacy tests. The outcome of our workshop will be a participatory web-platform for collectively created visualization literacy tests and questionnaires that can directly be used by researchers in our community.<br/><br/><strong>Organizers—</strong>Sung-Hee Kim, Jeremy Boy, Sukwon Lee, Ji Soo Yi, and Niklas Elmqvist<br/><br/><strong>Keywords—</strong>Human-centered computing, Visualization, Empirical studies in visualization, Social and professional topics, Professional topics, Computing education, Computing literacy", img: null, img_lg: null, video: "<iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/102527957?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=FFFFFF&amp;autoplay=1;badge=0' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>", video_note: "Video by Jeremy Boy.", width: 1, link: "http://visualizationliteracy.org/workshop", pdf: "", bib: "" },

As visualizations are now often used as “new media” (<em>e.g.</em>, for journalistic purposes), we need to bridge the gap between visual communication and information visualization (Infovis). Inspirations can be found in the practices of graphic and motion design. Graphic design can inform us on how to communicate using visual forms, and motion design can provide a wide range of design solutions for creating film-like visual effects. Here, we introduce a way in which these inspirations can impact visualization design choices, and illustrate it with our implementation of the CO2 Pollution map. This visualization presents a visual metaphor for pollution, built upon a particle system that both encodes the data and helps users interpret what they are about. We discuss some of the benefits and tradeoffs of this design, and conclude by presenting early insights into the impact of the design choices we made for the CO2 Pollution map.", img: null, img_lg: "vl.png", video: null, video_note: null, width: 1, link: "http://peopleviz.gforge.inria.fr/trunk/vLiteracy/home/", pdf: null, bib: null },
